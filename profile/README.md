## 💎 What Makes This Different?

## 🔥 Why We Exist

Saphyre Solutions was founded by **Tim Spurlin**, a disabled Air Force veteran who knows what it means to fight for opportunity. After being granted this sponsorship from Microsoft, Tim made a decision most wouldn’t:

> **“We were given this gift freely—so we’re going to give it freely, too.”**

While others might monetize access or build paywalls, **Tim chose purpose over profit**. This entire initiative is built on *impact*, not income.
